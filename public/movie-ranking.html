<h1>The Best Movies - Adrian's Version</h1>
<h2>My top 3 best movies and why!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Alien (Saga)</h3>
<p>This movie goes to the first place because it is the foundation, in my opinion, to most of the recent sci-fi movies. It is excellent in terms of acting, story and special effects.</p>
<h3>Red, White & Royal Blue</h3>
<p>How refreshing it is to finally being able to see a gay rom-com, which includes a love story that does not end up in tragedy. This is a nice reminder that fairy tales exist, even for the gays.</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings (Saga)</h3>
<p>Hands down, the "Lord of the Rings" is the best fantasy adaptation to the big screen. The story telling is captivating, the photography is immaculate. Everything about this movie is a classic.</p>
